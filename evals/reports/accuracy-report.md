# Accuracy Evaluation

**Generated:** 2026-01-17T14:29:38.799828+00:00

**Duration:** N/A


This report tracks the structural accuracy of CodeBoarding's generated diagrams against a curated ground-truth dataset. We measure how well the agent captures system topology, component relationships, and architectural hierarchy.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Scoring

Our evaluation uses a **"Model-as-a-Judge"** approach to compare the `analysis.json` generated by CodeBoarding against a human-verified `train.json`.

### Scoring Criteria (1-10)

- **Node Coverage:** Overlap of identified components and nodes.
- **Relationship Fidelity:** Correctness of edges (source, target, and type).
- **Structural Coherence:** Overall topology and flow alignment.

| Commit | Project | Depth | Score | Node Coverage | Relationship Fidelity | Structural Coherence |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| a1c84ff | markitdown | 1 | 5.00 | Both diagrams include a similar set of components related to document conversion, but they differ in naming and specific implementations of converters. | The relationships between nodes in both diagrams show some alignment in purpose, but the specific connections and types of relationships differ significantly. | While both diagrams depict a conversion framework, the overall architecture and flow differ, with the generated diagram introducing additional layers and components not present in the dataset diagram. |
