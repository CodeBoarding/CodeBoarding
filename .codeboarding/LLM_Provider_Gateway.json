This agent relies heavily on the LLM Provider Gateway to abstract and manage interactions with various Large Language Models. The gateway ensures a standardized interface for LLM communication, handling provider-specific complexities, authentication, and response parsing, thereby enabling the CodeBoardingAgent to focus on its primary task of code interpretation and documentation generation.",
