  "description": "The `agents` subsystem is centered around the `CodeBoardingAgent`, which acts as the primary `Agent` and also embodies the `LLM Provider Gateway` and `LLM Client Orchestrator` functionalities. The `CodeBoardingAgent` directly manages the selection and initialization of various `Specific LLM Integrations` (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatAnthropic`) based on available API keys. This design allows the agent to dynamically adapt to different LLM providers without external factory components. The `Agent` sends requests to the `LLM Provider Gateway` (which is part of itself) and receives responses, abstracting the underlying LLM communication details. The `LLM Client Orchestrator` within the `CodeBoardingAgent` is responsible for instantiating the correct `Specific LLM Integrations`, which then handle the actual communication with external LLM services.",
