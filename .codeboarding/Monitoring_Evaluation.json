  "description": "The evaluation subsystem is orchestrated by the `Evaluation Core`, which provides the foundational framework for defining and executing evaluation pipelines. Users interact with this core functionality via the `Evaluation CLI`, enabling them to configure and trigger evaluations. During execution, the `Evaluation Core` utilizes `Monitoring Callbacks` to capture real-time event data. These `Monitoring Callbacks` then delegate the persistent storage of this data to `Monitoring Data Writers`, ensuring all evaluation metrics and events are accurately recorded. Conversely, the `Evaluation Core` also interacts directly with `Monitoring Data Writers` to retrieve or manage stored evaluation results, completing the feedback loop for analysis and reporting.",
