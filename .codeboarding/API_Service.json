  "description": "The CodeBoarding system is structured around a pipeline that processes code analysis requests and generates architectural insights. The API Service serves as the external entry point, receiving user requests and initiating analysis jobs. These jobs are then managed by the Orchestration Engine, which coordinates the entire analysis workflow. The Orchestration Engine interacts with the Repository Manager to fetch and prepare codebases for analysis. The prepared code is then fed into the Static Analysis Engine, which extracts structural and behavioral information. The raw analysis results are subsequently passed to the AI Interpretation Layer, where Large Language Models interpret the data to identify architectural patterns and generate high-level insights. Finally, the Output Generation Engine takes these interpreted insights to produce various artifacts, including architectural diagrams and documentation, which are then made available through the API Service. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for modular development and efficient processing of code analysis tasks.",
