  "description": "The CodeBoarding system operates with an `API Service` as its entry point, handling user requests and initiating code analysis jobs. These jobs are managed by an `Orchestration Engine` which coordinates the entire workflow, from fetching code via the `Repository Manager` to executing the `Analysis Pipeline` (encompassing static analysis and AI interpretation). The `Job Database` maintains the state and metadata of all ongoing and completed jobs. Once the analysis is complete, the `Output Generation Engine` formats the results into user-consumable documentation and visualizations, which are then retrieved by the `API Service`. A `Configuration & Utilities` component provides essential services and settings across the entire system, ensuring consistent operation and reusability. This architecture supports an asynchronous, pipeline-driven approach to code documentation and analysis.",

      "description": "The API Service acts as the primary external interface for CodeBoarding, responsible for receiving and processing user requests related to code analysis and visualization. It handles the initiation of new analysis jobs, provides mechanisms for users to retrieve the status of ongoing jobs, and serves the final analysis results, including generated documentation and visualizations. Furthermore, it integrates with external systems like GitHub Actions to trigger automated documentation generation workflows. This component is crucial for orchestrating the interaction between users and the backend analysis pipeline, aligning with the project's pipeline/event-driven and producer-consumer architectural patterns.",
