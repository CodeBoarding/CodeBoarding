  "description": "The system is built around a `FastAPI Application` that serves as the central entry point for all client interactions. It exposes various API endpoints, including those for general job management and specialized `GitHub Action Endpoints`. The `FastAPI Application` delegates the creation of new documentation generation jobs to the `Job Creator`, which initializes job records and interacts with the `Job Database Interface` for persistent storage. The `Job Status Manager` is crucial for tracking the lifecycle of each job, with updates and retrievals facilitated through the `Job Database Interface`. The core logic for processing documentation generation is encapsulated within the `Job Processor`, an asynchronous component that orchestrates the entire pipeline, from repository cloning to content generation, and reports its progress and results back via the `Job Status Manager` and `Job Database Interface`. The `GitHub Action Endpoints` specifically leverage the `Job Creator` and `Job Processor` to automate documentation generation within GitHub workflows and retrieve job statuses from the `Job Database Interface`.",
