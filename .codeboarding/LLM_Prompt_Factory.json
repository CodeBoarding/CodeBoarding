  "description": "The `agents.prompts` subsystem provides a flexible and extensible mechanism for generating LLM-specific prompts. It is centered around the `AbstractPromptFactory`, which establishes a common interface for all prompt creation logic. The `PromptFactory` serves as the concrete implementation, dynamically selecting and instantiating specialized prompt factories based on the target LLM and desired prompt characteristics. This design pattern enables the system to seamlessly integrate with diverse LLM providers and prompt variations, ensuring consistent and adaptable prompt generation throughout the application. The `PromptFactory` delegates the actual retrieval of prompt messages to the chosen concrete `AbstractPromptFactory` implementation, effectively decoupling prompt content from the prompt selection mechanism.",
