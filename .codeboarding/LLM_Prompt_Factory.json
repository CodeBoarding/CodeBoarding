  "description": "The prompt generation subsystem is centered around the `PromptFactory`, which serves as the primary interface for constructing LLM-optimized prompts. Instead of directly implementing prompt generation logic, `PromptFactory` leverages a composition pattern, utilizing an instance of `AbstractPromptFactory`. This `AbstractPromptFactory` defines the common interface for prompt creation, allowing various concrete prompt factories (e.g., for different LLMs like Gemini Flash or Claude) to provide specific implementations. This architectural choice ensures modularity, extensibility, and a consistent approach to prompt generation across diverse analysis tasks within the project's AI Interpretation Layer.",

It ensures a consistent and standardized approach to creating prompts, regardless of the specific LLM or analysis task.

It interprets static analysis results, applies task-specific parameters, and constructs LLM-optimized prompts by *composing* and *delegating* the actual prompt generation to an instance of `AbstractPromptFactory`. This design allows `PromptFactory` to remain decoupled from the specifics of prompt generation, promoting flexibility and extensibility.
