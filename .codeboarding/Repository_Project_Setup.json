  "description": "The core functionality of this subsystem revolves around the systematic preparation and initial analysis of a code repository. The process begins with the acquisition of the repository, followed by the application of filtering rules, and culminates in a structural scan. This sequential flow ensures that subsequent, more detailed analyses operate on a clean, relevant, and well-understood subset of the codebase.",
