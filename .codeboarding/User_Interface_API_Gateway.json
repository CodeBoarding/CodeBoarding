  "description": "The CodeBoarding system is structured around an `API Service` that acts as the primary interface for users to generate architectural documentation and diagrams from GitHub repositories. This service, built with FastAPI, handles job creation and status retrieval, offloading the computationally intensive `Documentation Generation` process to asynchronous background tasks. A `Job Management` component is responsible for persisting job states and results, ensuring reliable tracking of each documentation request. During the `Documentation Generation` phase, a `Temporary Repository Manager` is utilized to handle the cloning and cleanup of repository data, isolating the generation process and maintaining system cleanliness. This architecture ensures a responsive user experience while efficiently managing resource-intensive analysis tasks.",
