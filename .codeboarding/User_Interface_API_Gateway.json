  "description": "The system is designed around a clear separation of concerns, with the API Service handling external requests and the Job Management component orchestrating the overall documentation generation workflow. The Documentation Generation component delegates core analysis and content creation to the CodeBoardingAgent, which serves as the central intelligence. The CodeBoardingAgent is supported by specialized components: Static Analysis Tools for deep code understanding and the Temporary Repository Manager for managing code repositories. A Configuration Manager provides centralized settings across the system, ensuring consistent operation. This architecture allows for robust, scalable documentation generation, with the CodeBoardingAgent continuously evolving its internal capabilities to improve analysis quality.",
