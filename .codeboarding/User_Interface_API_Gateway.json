  "description": "The system's core functionality revolves around the `local_app` component, which acts as the primary interface for external clients. `local_app` processes incoming requests, and based on these, it initiates complex analysis workflows by interacting with the `Orchestration Engine`. To manage and track the state of these analytical tasks, `local_app` queries the `Job Database` for persistent storage of job-related information. Furthermore, `local_app` relies on the `Configuration & Utilities` component for essential operational settings and shared functionalities, ensuring a consistent and efficient execution environment. This architecture delineates clear responsibilities, with `local_app` managing external interactions, the `Orchestration Engine` orchestrating internal processes, the `Job Database` maintaining state, and `Configuration & Utilities` providing foundational support.",
