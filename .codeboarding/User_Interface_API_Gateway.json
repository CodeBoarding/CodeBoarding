  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the `local_app` component, which acts as the primary API Gateway, managing all external client interactions. It orchestrates analysis workflows by initiating tasks with the `Orchestration Engine` and monitors their progress by querying the `Job Database`. For operational parameters and common functionalities, `local_app` leverages shared services from `Configuration & Utilities`. The system also incorporates an `Unclassified` component, which has recently evolved to include an expanded `repo_utils` package with enhanced utilities, particularly for git diff functionalities, and updated GPT prompt definitions within `agents/prompts`, significantly influencing agent behavior. This `Unclassified` component provides essential underlying functionalities utilized by `local_app` and potentially other parts of the system.",
