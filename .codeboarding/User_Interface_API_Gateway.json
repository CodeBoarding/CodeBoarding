  "description": "The system's core flow begins with the API Service receiving requests, which are then managed by Job Management. Job Management orchestrates the Documentation Generation process. The Documentation Generation component delegates the crucial task of understanding the codebase and generating content to the CodeBoardingAgent. The CodeBoardingAgent, acting as the central intelligence, leverages the Static Analysis Tools for deep code understanding, which has been significantly enhanced through an updated LSP client. It also uses the Temporary Repository Manager to access and manage the codebase. All components rely on the Configuration Manager for system settings. The refined internal mechanisms of CodeBoardingAgent and the enhanced Static Analysis Tools lead to more robust and accurate documentation generation.",
