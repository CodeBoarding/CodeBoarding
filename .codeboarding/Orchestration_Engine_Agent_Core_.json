  "description": "The system operates around a central Orchestration Engine (Agent Core), embodied by `agents.meta_agent.MetaAgent`, which directs the entire code analysis and documentation generation process. This engine initiates the Static Analysis Engine (`static_analyzer.scanner.Scanner`) to extract raw code findings. These findings are then passed back to the Orchestration Engine, which subsequently dispatches them to the AI Interpretation Layer (`agents.abstraction_agent.AbstractionAgent`). This layer leverages AI to transform raw data into meaningful architectural insights. The interpreted insights are returned to the Orchestration Engine, which then feeds them into the Output Generation Engine (`output_generators.markdown.MarkdownOutputGenerator`) to produce various documentation and diagram formats. Throughout this workflow, the Job Management & Persistence component (`duckdb_crud.DuckDBCRUD`) is responsible for maintaining the state of analysis jobs and persisting all relevant data, ensuring continuity and retrievability of results.",
