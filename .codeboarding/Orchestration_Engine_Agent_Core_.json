  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the `CodeBoardingAgent`, which acts as the intelligent core for processing user queries. The `Query Processor` initiates the workflow by forwarding user requests to the `CodeBoardingAgent`. The `CodeBoardingAgent` then orchestrates complex interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) and a suite of specialized `Tools`. It dynamically selects and invokes these `Tools` to gather necessary information and perform static code analysis. After receiving results from the `Tools` and further refining its understanding with the LLM, the `CodeBoardingAgent` is responsible for parsing and formatting the final response, which is then delivered back to the `Query Processor` for presentation to the user. This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the `CodeBoardingAgent` managing the intelligent reasoning and execution, while `Tools` provide specific functionalities and the `Query Processor` handles user interaction.",
