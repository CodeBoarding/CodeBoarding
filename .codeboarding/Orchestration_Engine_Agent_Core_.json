  "description": "The system is structured around a core agentic loop, starting with the `Query Processor` which handles user input and orchestrates the overall flow. It passes the query to the `Language Model Interface`, responsible for interacting with the underlying LLM. The LLM's output, which may include a decision to use external capabilities, is then directed to the `Tool Executor`. This component is central to the system's extensibility, managing the invocation of various `Tools` and processing their outcomes. Recent modifications in `agents/agent.py` highlight ongoing enhancements to the `Tool Executor`'s logic, improving how tools are executed and their results handled. After tool execution, results are fed back to the `Language Model Interface` for further reasoning or to generate a conclusive response. Finally, the `Response Formatter` synthesizes and formats the LLM's output into a user-friendly message, which is then returned via the `Query Processor`. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, enabling flexible interaction with LLMs and external tools.",
