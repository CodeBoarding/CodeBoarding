  "description": "The system is designed around a reactive agent architecture, with the Query Processor serving as the initial interface for user requests. These requests are then managed by the CodeBoardingAgent, which acts as the central orchestrator. The CodeBoardingAgent leverages an external Large Language Model for intelligent reasoning and decision-making, and it dynamically invokes various Tools to perform specialized static code analysis and data retrieval. The recent introduction of an AbstractionAgent component suggests an evolving design pattern, where CodeBoardingAgent may become a concrete implementation, benefiting from a more generalized and extensible agent framework. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexible interaction with external AI models and robust internal analysis capabilities.",
