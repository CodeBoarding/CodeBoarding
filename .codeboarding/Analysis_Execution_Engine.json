  "description": "The CodeBoarding backend subsystem is a service-oriented architecture designed to bridge the gap between static analysis and interactive visualization. At its core, the Analysis Orchestrator manages the flow of data and commands, delegating the complex task of process execution to the Execution Lifecycle Manager. This manager leverages a Binary Runtime Resolver to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Once analysis is complete, the Analysis Data Repository works with the Graph Transformation Engine to hydrate the frontend with visualization-ready data. The Architectural Lookup Service completes the loop by providing the metadata necessary for linking physical source files back to their logical architectural components, facilitating a seamless \"Code-to-Architecture\" navigation experience.",
