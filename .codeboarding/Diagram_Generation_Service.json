  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around an Orchestration Engine that manages the entire code analysis and documentation generation workflow. It interfaces with an API Service for job initiation and delivery, and a Job Database for status management. Code acquisition and filtering are handled by the Repository Manager, which then feeds into the Static Analysis Engine for initial code analysis. The core intelligence resides in the AI Interpretation Layer, which employs specialized MetaAgent and PlannerAgent components to derive architectural insights and strategic analysis plans from the static analysis results. These insights are then relayed back to the Orchestration Engine for final documentation generation. Finally, the Diagram Generation Service converts structured architectural data into visual diagrams, enhancing comprehension.",
