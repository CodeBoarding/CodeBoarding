  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the `diagram_analysis` subsystem, which comprises `analysis_json` for data preparation and `diagram_generator` for visual output. A newly integrated `agents` component introduces intelligent agent capabilities, exhibiting a strong, bidirectional interaction with the `diagram_analysis` components. The `analysis_json` component processes raw architectural data into a structured format, which is then consumed by the `diagram_generator` to create visual representations. The `agents` component, responsible for agent behavior and orchestration, either provides input to the diagram generation process or leverages the diagram analysis for its operations, indicating a tightly coupled relationship for enhanced system understanding and control.",
