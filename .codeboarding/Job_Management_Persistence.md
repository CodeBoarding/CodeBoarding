## Details

The feedback highlights that the identified components (JobManager, PersistenceLayer, QueueingMechanism, OrchestrationEngine, APIServiceGateway, OutputGenerationEngine) have incorrect references, as no such modules, functions, or classes exist in the project. The `getFileStructure` output reveals a `.codeboarding` directory containing several `.json` and `.md` files, which likely hold architectural descriptions. To address the feedback, I will first examine the `overview.md` file within the `.codeboarding` directory to gain a high-level understanding of the project's architecture and then investigate other `.md` files for specific component definitions. This approach will help in identifying the correct references for the conceptual components.
