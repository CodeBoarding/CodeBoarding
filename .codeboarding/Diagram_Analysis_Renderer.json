  "description": "The system is orchestrated by the Output Generation Engine, which initiates the analysis process. It delegates detailed code interpretation, abstraction, planning, and validation to the Agent Orchestration component. The Agent Orchestration component, in turn, relies heavily on the Static Analyzer for foundational code understanding. The Static Analyzer has been significantly enhanced with a deeper integration of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) through its LSPClient, enabling it to extract comprehensive structural and semantic information, including call graphs, class hierarchies, and package dependencies. This rich data is then consumed by the Agent Orchestration's expanded toolset to perform sophisticated analysis. Finally, the Output Generation Engine uses the Analysis Data Formatter to convert the processed analysis into a standardized JSON format for architectural diagram generation.",
