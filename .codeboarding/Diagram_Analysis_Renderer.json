  "description": "The system's architecture is composed of four key components: the `Output Generation Engine`, `Agent Orchestration`, `Static Analyzer`, and `Analysis Data Formatter`. The `Output Generation Engine` acts as the central control, orchestrating the entire analysis workflow from initial code processing to final output generation. It delegates the complex task of code interpretation and insight generation to the `Agent Orchestration` component, which in turn leverages the `Static Analyzer` for fundamental, language-specific source code analysis. Once the `Agent Orchestration` completes its tasks, the `Output Generation Engine` directs the results to the `Analysis Data Formatter`, ensuring that all generated architectural insights are consistently structured into a standardized JSON format, ready for seamless integration with diagramming tools and comprehensive documentation.",
