  "description": "The Output Generation Engine serves as the central orchestrator for transforming raw code analysis into structured, human-readable outputs, primarily in JSON format for subsequent diagram generation. It leverages a suite of specialized agents to perform detailed analysis, abstraction, planning, and validation. The engine's primary responsibility is to manage the workflow of these agents, process components in a multi-level, parallel fashion, and persist the generated analysis in a structured format that can be consumed by external rendering tools to visualize architectural diagrams.",
