  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the DiagramGenerator, which acts as the primary orchestrator, initiating and managing the architectural analysis workflow. It coordinates a suite of Analysis Agents, each specialized for different aspects of code analysis, from metadata gathering to detailed structural examination. These Analysis Agents critically depend on the StaticAnalyzer component, which provides foundational static code analysis capabilities by extracting structural and semantic information from the codebase. Recent enhancements to the StaticAnalyzer's Language Server Protocol (LSP) client have further improved its ability to deliver comprehensive code insights, thereby empowering the Analysis Agents to perform more robust and accurate analyses. The DiagramGenerator then consolidates and persists the architectural insights generated through this collaborative process.",
