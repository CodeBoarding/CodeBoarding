  "description": "The system's primary objective is to generate structured architectural analysis outputs. This process is initiated and managed by the Output Generation Engine, which orchestrates the entire workflow. It delegates the complex task of code interpretation and detailed analysis to the Agent Orchestration component. The Agent Orchestration component, in turn, relies heavily on the Static Analyzer to acquire foundational and semantic understanding of the codebase. Once the analysis is complete, the Output Generation Engine utilizes the Analysis Data Formatter to convert the internal analysis objects into a standardized JSON format, suitable for external consumption and diagram rendering.",
