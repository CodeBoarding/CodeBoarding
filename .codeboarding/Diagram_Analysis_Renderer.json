  "description": "The diagram_analysis subsystem is centered around the DiagramGenerator, which acts as the primary orchestrator for generating architectural insights. It initiates and manages a suite of Analysis Agents, each specialized in a particular aspect of code analysis, such as metadata extraction, detailed component examination, abstraction, and validation. These agents rely on the StaticAnalyzer to obtain fundamental structural information about the codebase. The DiagramGenerator coordinates the parallel execution of these agents across different levels of architectural depth, iteratively refining the analysis based on feedback. The final output of this orchestrated process is a set of structured Analysis Files, which serve as a persistent record of the derived architectural components and their relationships, ready for consumption by documentation or visualization tools.",
