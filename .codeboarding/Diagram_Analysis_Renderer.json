  "description": "The CodeBoarding system is designed to generate architectural documentation and diagrams from source code repositories. The process begins with the API Service / User Interface, which allows users to initiate analysis jobs and retrieve results. The Orchestration Engine acts as the central coordinator, managing the lifecycle of each analysis job, dispatching tasks to other components, and updating job statuses in the Job Database. The Repository Manager is responsible for fetching and managing source code from various repositories. The retrieved code is then processed by the Static Analysis Engine, which extracts structural and semantic information. This raw analysis data is fed into the AI Interpretation Layer, where AI/ML models interpret it into high-level architectural insights. The Diagram Analysis & Renderer component utilizes these insights to produce structured analysis results, which are then consumed by the Output Generation Engine to generate documentation in various formats, including visual diagrams.",
