  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around three core components: the Orchestration Engine, the Repository Manager, and the Static Analysis Engine. The Orchestration Engine acts as the central coordinator, initiating and managing the overall analysis workflow. It instructs the Repository Manager to handle all interactions with code repositories, including cloning and fetching updates, and managing temporary repository folders. Once the source code is available, the Repository Manager provides access to it for the Static Analysis Engine. The Static Analysis Engine then performs a detailed examination of the code, generating analysis results that can be used for various downstream tasks. This clear separation of concerns ensures a modular and maintainable system, with each component focusing on its specialized functionality.",
