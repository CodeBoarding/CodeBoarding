  "description": "The system is designed around three core components: Repository Access & Control, Temporary Workspace Manager, and Content Deployment Handler. The Repository Access & Control component is responsible for fetching and managing code from remote repositories, ensuring the correct version is available for processing. It interacts with the Temporary Workspace Manager to establish isolated environments for these operations. The Temporary Workspace Manager handles the lifecycle of temporary file system locations, creating them as needed and ensuring their proper cleanup. Finally, the Content Deployment Handler takes the generated output and deploys it back to a specified repository, also leveraging the Temporary Workspace Manager for any temporary file handling during this process. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated components for repository interaction, temporary resource management, and content delivery.",
