  "description": "The core of this subsystem revolves around the `DiffAnalyzingAgent`, which acts as the orchestrator for analyzing code changes within a project. It is responsible for managing the overall diff analysis workflow, from retrieving existing analysis and fetching new diff data to processing and interpreting these changes. The `DiffAnalyzingAgent` directly leverages the `Git Diff Utility` to obtain granular file change information, which it then uses to determine the degree of update required for the project's analysis. This streamlined architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the orchestrator managing the analysis process and the utility providing the essential diffing capabilities.",
