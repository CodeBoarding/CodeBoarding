  "description": "The Repository Manager subsystem is responsible for managing all interactions with code repositories, encompassing fetching source code and handling file system access. It acts as the primary interface for the project to retrieve and navigate the codebase under analysis. Within this subsystem, the File Content Reader and File Structure Reader are specialized tools that perform distinct but complementary functions. The Repository Manager itself acts as the coordinating entity, routing requests to the appropriate reader component. Both reader components directly interface with the underlying file system to fulfill their responsibilities, providing the foundational data necessary for the broader code analysis and documentation generation process.",
