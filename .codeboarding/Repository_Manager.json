  "description": "The system is structured around an Agent Orchestrator that drives various analytical tasks. This orchestrator dynamically obtains specialized prompt templates from the Prompt Factory Subsystem, which employs an Abstract Factory pattern to ensure flexible and context-specific prompt generation. To execute its tasks, the Agent Orchestrator leverages a suite of Agent Tools. These tools encapsulate specific functionalities, such as interacting with the Diff Analyzer to process code changes. The Diff Analyzer, in turn, relies on the Git Operations Utility for low-level Git interactions, providing a clear separation of concerns for repository data retrieval and processing. This architecture promotes modularity, allowing for easy extension of agents, prompts, and tools while maintaining a clear flow of information and control.",
