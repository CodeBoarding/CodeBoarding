  "description": "The system is designed around a core `Orchestration Engine` that manages the entire codebase analysis workflow. This engine interacts with the `Repository Manager` to acquire source code, which is then passed to the `Static Analysis Engine` for initial processing. The raw analysis data is subsequently fed into the `AI Interpretation Layer`, where Large Language Models generate insights and documentation drafts. The `Output Generation Engine` takes these drafts and formats them into various consumable outputs. An `API Service` provides the external interface for users to initiate analysis jobs, monitor their status, and retrieve results. All job-related information is persisted in the `Job Database`, while the `Configuration Management` component centralizes system settings and credentials, ensuring consistent operation across all components.",
