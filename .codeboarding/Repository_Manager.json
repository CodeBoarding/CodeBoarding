  "description": "The core of this code analysis system revolves around the Repository Manager, which serves as the primary interface for all code repository operations. It is responsible for cloning, managing, and providing access to local copies of code from Remote Git Services, storing them on the Local File System. The raw code and repository data managed by the Repository Manager are then fed into two subsequent processing stages: the Static Analysis Engine, which performs automated code analysis, and the AI Interpretation Layer, which applies advanced AI/ML models for deeper insights. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the Repository Manager handling all source code acquisition and management, enabling other components to focus on analysis and interpretation.",
