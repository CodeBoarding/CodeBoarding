  "description": "The system is designed around a core `Orchestration Engine` that manages the entire static analysis workflow. This engine directs the `Repository Manager` to access project source files, which are then provided to the `Static Analysis Engine`. The `Static Analysis Engine` is responsible for performing detailed code analysis by interacting with an external `Language Server` through the Language Server Protocol. The `Setup and Configuration Manager` plays a crucial role in ensuring all necessary external dependencies for the analysis process are correctly installed and configured. Ultimately, the `Orchestration Engine` aggregates and processes the results from the `Static Analysis Engine`, completing the analysis cycle. Recent internal updates to agents managed by the `Orchestration Engine` and dependency configurations handled by the `Setup and Configuration Manager` have enhanced the system's capabilities without altering its fundamental high-level architecture.",
