  "description": "The system operates by orchestrating a series of analysis and generation tasks. The `Orchestration Engine` initiates and manages the entire workflow. It instructs the `Repository Manager` to fetch or update the codebase, which then provides the source code to the `Static Analysis Engine`. The `Static Analysis Engine`, now with enhanced and specialized capabilities for TypeScript analysis, performs in-depth code analysis, extracting structural information and dependencies. It also retrieves analysis rules and configurations from `Configuration Management`. The extracted code insights are then passed to the `AI Interpretation Layer`, which leverages LLMs to interpret the context and generate architectural patterns and documentation drafts. These drafts are subsequently sent to the `Output Generation Engine` for formatting and rendering into various output formats, utilizing templates and styling rules from `Configuration Management`. Finally, the `API Service` provides an interface for users to submit jobs, monitor status, and retrieve the generated documentation and analysis results, querying the `Job Database` for job status and results.",
