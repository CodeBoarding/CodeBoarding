  "description": "The system is designed around an `Agent Orchestrator` that directs intelligent agents. This orchestrator dynamically acquires prompts from the `Prompt Factory Subsystem` to guide agent behavior. For task execution and information gathering, the `Agent Orchestrator` interacts with `Agent Tools`, which encapsulate various functionalities. These tools include the `Diff Analyzer` for identifying and processing code changes, and the `Static Analyzer` for performing in-depth code analysis without execution. Both the `Diff Analyzer` and `Static Analyzer` depend on the `Git Operations Utility` to access and retrieve necessary code from repositories. The insights generated by the `Static Analyzer` are then fed back to the `Agent Orchestrator` to inform subsequent decision-making and actions.",
