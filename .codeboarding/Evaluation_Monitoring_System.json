  "description": "The `Evaluation & Monitoring System` subsystem is dedicated to assessing the performance and behavior of the CodeBoarding system and its AI agents. Its boundaries are primarily defined by the `evals/` and `monitoring/` directories, which house the core evaluation framework and the infrastructure for collecting and persisting usage data. This design ensures that evaluation logic is decoupled from monitoring data storage, promoting modularity and extensibility, which is characteristic of a well-structured Code Analysis and Documentation Generation Tool.",
