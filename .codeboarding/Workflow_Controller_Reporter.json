  "description": "The CodeBoarding subsystem is designed as an agentic documentation pipeline that bridges static analysis with LLM-powered synthesis. It features a dual-entry architecture: a CLI engine for local developer workflows and an asynchronous FastAPI gateway for managing remote documentation jobs. Central to the system is an orchestration layer that sequences repository cloning, agent-based code abstraction, and multi-format report generation. Runtime integrity and cost tracking are managed by a specialized execution monitor that streams telemetry to local storage, while job states are persisted in a lightweight DuckDB backend. The final output is delivered via two specialized generators: one producing static Markdown with Mermaid diagrams for source control integration, and another creating interactive HTML reports with dynamic dependency graphs via a dedicated GitHub Action logic module.",
