  "description": "The prompt management subsystem is designed with a clear separation of concerns. The Prompt Abstraction Layer, represented by AbstractPromptFactory, establishes a foundational contract for prompt creation, ensuring a consistent interface for various prompt generation strategies. This abstraction allows for different concrete prompt factories (which would implement AbstractPromptFactory) to be interchanged without affecting higher-level logic. The Prompt Orchestration Layer, embodied by PromptFactory, acts as a central coordinator. It does not implement AbstractPromptFactory directly but rather uses the Prompt Abstraction Layer to manage and retrieve specific prompt instances. This design ensures that the orchestration logic remains decoupled from the specifics of prompt generation, promoting flexibility and maintainability.",
