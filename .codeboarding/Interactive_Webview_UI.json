  "description": "The CodeBoarding UI subsystem follows a state-driven orchestration pattern centered around a main `Bridge Controller`. This controller acts as the single source of truth, receiving raw architecture data from the VS Code backend and distributing it to two major sibling branches: the `Graph Orchestrator` for the interactive visualization and the `Instructional Overlay` for user guidance. The `Graph Orchestrator` encapsulates the complexity of the React Flow environment, delegating heavy computational tasks like coordinate layout to the `Layout Engine` and topological safety checks to the `Graph Integrity Guard`. Rendering is offloaded to specialized `Node` and `Edge` renderers, ensuring a clear separation between the graph's logical structure and its visual representation within the VS Code theme.",
