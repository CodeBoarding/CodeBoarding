## Details

The CodeBoarding project is structured around a pipeline that orchestrates code analysis, AI-driven interpretation, and documentation/diagram generation. The Orchestration Engine initiates and manages this entire process, delegating tasks to specialized components. The Static Analysis Engine first processes the raw source code to generate structural representations like CFGs. This data is then fed into the AI Processing Layer, which leverages LLMs to derive high-level architectural insights. These insights are subsequently transformed into various documentation formats by the Output Generation Engine and visual diagrams by the Diagram Generation Service. This modular design ensures clear separation of concerns and a streamlined flow from raw code to comprehensive architectural documentation and visualizations.

### Orchestration Engine [[Expand]](./Orchestration_Engine.md)
The central control unit managing the entire code analysis and documentation generation pipeline. It coordinates the execution flow, from static analysis to AI interpretation and final output generation.

### Output Generation Engine [[Expand]](./Output_Generation_Engine.md)
Takes the structured architectural insights from the AI Processing Layer and formats them into various output types, such as documentation files (Markdown, JSON), reports, or raw data suitable for diagram generation.
