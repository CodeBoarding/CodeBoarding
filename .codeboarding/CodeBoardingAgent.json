  "description": "The CodeBoarding system is designed around a central `CodeBoardingAgent` that orchestrates the entire code analysis and documentation workflow. External requests are received via an `API Service`, which initiates the agent's operations. The `CodeBoardingAgent` first interacts with the `Repository Manager` to fetch source code. This code is then processed by the `Static Analysis Engine` for foundational analysis, with results subsequently interpreted by the `AI Processing Layer` using LLMs to derive high-level insights. Finally, the `Output Generation Engine` formats these insights into various documentation outputs. Throughout this process, the `CodeBoardingAgent` maintains job state and data integrity by interacting with a `Job Database` and utilizes a `CodeBoardingToolkit` for specialized analytical tasks.",
