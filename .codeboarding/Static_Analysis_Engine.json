  "description": "The static analysis subsystem is designed around a modular pipeline that transforms raw source code into structured graph representations. The `Scanner` initiates the process with lexical analysis, followed by the `LSP Client` which leverages external language servers to provide rich parsed data, including Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The `Reference Resolver` then identifies and resolves symbolic links within this parsed information. Both the ASTs and resolved references are consumed by the `Graph Builder` to construct Control Flow Graphs (CFGs), forming the core analytical output. `Programming Language Support` underpins these operations by supplying language-specific configurations and rules. The `Analysis Result Handler` serves as the interface for managing and storing the diverse outputs of this analysis. The `Unclassified` component houses supporting utilities, such as `repo_utils/ignore.py`, which can influence the initial file processing scope for components like the `Scanner` and `LSP Client`, without altering their fundamental responsibilities. This architecture prioritizes clear separation of concerns and leverages external language services for robust parsing capabilities.",
