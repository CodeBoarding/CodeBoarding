  "description": "The static analysis subsystem of `CodeBoarding` is responsible for processing source code to extract various structural and semantic representations. This subsystem is composed of four main components: the `Project Scanner`, which identifies the programming languages and files within a repository; the `LSP Client`, which communicates with external Language Servers to obtain detailed semantic information, including Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs); the `CFG Generator`, which constructs Control Flow Graphs from the ASTs; and the `Code Representation Generator`, which extracts additional structural representations like symbol tables and dependency graphs. These components work in concert to transform raw source code into a rich set of data structures suitable for further analysis and interpretation.",
