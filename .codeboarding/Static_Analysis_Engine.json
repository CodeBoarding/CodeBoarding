  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around a robust static analysis pipeline. The Scanner initiates the process by parsing source code, leveraging enhanced language definitions to generate fundamental data. This data is then consumed by the Static Analysis Engine Core, which performs deeper analysis and produces structured outputs. An Agent component utilizes these analytical services to execute higher-level tasks and seamlessly integrates with the VSCode environment through the VSCode Integration component, managing IDE-specific interactions and configurations. All these core components rely on a set of External Dependencies for their functionality, ensuring a modular and extensible design. The main flow involves the Scanner feeding parsed data to the Static Analysis Engine Core, which then processes it and provides insights to the Agent. The Agent, in turn, coordinates with the VSCode Integration for IDE interactions, with all components underpinned by External Dependencies.",
