  "description": "The analysis subsystem follows a Mediated Execution Architecture, where the Analysis Orchestrator acts as a central hub connecting user-facing actions to low-level system operations. The execution flow begins with environment preparation, where the Asset Lifecycle Manager ensures binary availability and the Runtime Environment Provider prepares the process context. The Process Execution Manager then handles the lifecycle of the external analysis core, feeding usage data back for license validation via the AWS Communication Service. Post-execution, the Analysis Data Manager utilizes the Graph Transformation Engine to normalize the complex codebase structure into a render-ready graph format, ensuring a decoupled relationship between raw analysis output and the final visualization.",
