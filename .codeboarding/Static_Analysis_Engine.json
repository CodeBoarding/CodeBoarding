  "description": "The Static Analysis Engine subsystem is responsible for performing deep, language-specific analysis and reference resolution on source code to produce comprehensive structural information. It begins with the Scanner parsing and tokenizing source code to generate an initial structural representation. The LSP Client (TypeScript) then enriches this data by interacting with Language Server Protocol servers to obtain detailed syntax and semantic information. Subsequently, the Reference Resolver Mixin leverages this enriched data to identify and link code references. Finally, all processed and enriched information, including initial structural data, semantic details, and resolved references, is aggregated and structured within the Analysis Result, which serves as the canonical output of the engine.",
