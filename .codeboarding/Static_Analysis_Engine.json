  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around a `Static Analysis Engine Core` that orchestrates in-depth code analysis, building upon the initial parsing performed by the `Scanner`. An `Agent` component leverages these analytical capabilities to execute higher-level tasks. A dedicated `VSCode Integration` component facilitates seamless interaction with the VSCode environment, providing a specialized interface for the `Agent`. The entire system's functionality is supported by `External Dependencies`, which are managed through project packaging.",
