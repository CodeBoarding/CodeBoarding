  "description": "The static analysis subsystem is centered around the ProjectScanner, which serves as the primary entry point for initiating code analysis. The ProjectScanner is responsible for identifying the programming languages present in a repository and preparing the codebase for deeper inspection. It delegates the actual file traversal and initial language identification to external tools. Following this, the LanguageSpecificAnalysis component, represented by LSPClient and its specialized implementations, takes over to perform detailed parsing, AST generation, CFG construction, and metric extraction for each identified language. Finally, the DataAggregators, exemplified by AnalysisResult, collect and consolidate all the generated analysis data into a coherent and structured report, making it ready for further consumption or visualization. This architecture emphasizes a clear separation of concerns, with the ProjectScanner orchestrating the overall flow and LanguageSpecificAnalysis handling the intricate details of code understanding, all culminating in a unified output from DataAggregators.",
