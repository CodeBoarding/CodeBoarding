  "description": "The system's core functionality revolves around static code analysis, orchestrated through a sequence of specialized components. The ProjectScanner initiates the process by identifying project languages and basic statistics. This information then guides the LSPClient to interact with Language Servers, extracting detailed code symbols and relationships. The CallGraph component consumes this data to construct a comprehensive control flow graph of the codebase, representing code entities and their interdependencies. A newly introduced Monitoring subsystem is deeply integrated into the application's main execution flow, observing and collecting operational metrics and events from these core components to provide insights into system performance and behavior.",
