  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around a `Scanner` that performs initial code ingestion and AST generation. For TypeScript projects, the `TypeScript Config Scanner` provides essential and comprehensive project configuration to the `TypeScript Client`. The `TypeScript Client`, now with significantly enhanced capabilities, then communicates with an external TypeScript Language Server (LSP) to extract rich semantic information, leveraging `VSCode Constants` for environment-specific parameters. The `Scanner` further utilizes a `Reference Resolution Mixin` to resolve code references, enabling deep code understanding and navigation across the project. This integrated approach ensures comprehensive and accurate static analysis, particularly for TypeScript codebases, with a strong emphasis on detailed semantic understanding and configuration-driven analysis.",
