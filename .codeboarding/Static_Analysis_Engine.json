  "description": "The static analysis subsystem is centered around the ProjectScanner, which acts as the primary orchestrator. The ProjectScanner is responsible for initiating the code scanning process, leveraging external tools like Tokei to gather raw code statistics and identify programming languages. It then delegates the construction of detailed ProgrammingLanguage objects to the ProgrammingLanguageBuilder, which encapsulates language-specific properties and configurations. Finally, the ProjectScanner collects and manages these ProgrammingLanguage objects, representing the detected languages and their associated metrics within the codebase. This clear separation of concerns ensures that scanning, language object creation, and data encapsulation are handled by distinct, focused components.",
