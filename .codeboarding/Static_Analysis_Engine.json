  "description": "The Static Analysis Engine subsystem is responsible for performing in-depth static analysis of a codebase to extract structural and control flow information. It begins by scanning the project to identify programming languages and gather high-level metadata. Subsequently, it leverages Language Servers (LSPs) to obtain detailed code information, which is then used to construct and maintain a call graph representing the codebase's entities and their interdependencies. The primary purpose is to generate a comprehensive understanding of the code's structure and relationships, forming the basis for further analysis and documentation.",
