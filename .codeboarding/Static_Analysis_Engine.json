  "description": "The user has indicated a significant architectural shift due to changes in `main.py` and `agents/agent.py`. The original analysis identified `Data Normalizer/Formatter` as the central orchestration component. However, the feedback suggests `main.py` now plays a more critical role in orchestration, and `agents/agent.py` introduces a new functional module. To address this, I need to understand the new orchestration logic in `main.py`, identify the purpose and interactions of the new module in `agents/agent.py`, re-evaluate the role of the `Data Normalizer/Formatter` in light of these changes, and update component relationships to reflect the new architecture. I will start by examining the content of `main.py` to understand its orchestration responsibilities. Then, I will investigate `agents/agent.py`.",
