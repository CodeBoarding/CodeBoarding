  "description": "The core of the system revolves around two primary agents, `AbstractionAgent` and `DetailsAgent`, which collaboratively perform AI-driven architectural analysis. The `AbstractionAgent` initiates the process by transforming raw static analysis data into high-level architectural concepts, leveraging LLMs for interpretation. Subsequently, the `DetailsAgent` refines these abstractions, extracting granular insights. Both agents rely on a `LLM Interaction Handler` to manage communication with various LLM providers, ensuring consistent API calls and response processing. A `Prompt Factory` component is crucial for both agents, providing optimized prompt templates and strategies to ensure effective and consistent interactions with the LLMs, thereby maintaining the quality and relevance of the architectural interpretations. This modular design allows for flexible integration of different LLM technologies and robust prompt management.",
