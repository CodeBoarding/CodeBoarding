  "description": "The AI Interpretation Layer is responsible for interfacing with various Large Language Model (LLM) providers to process static analysis results and user prompts. Its primary function is to interpret code context and generate architectural insights, encompassing both high-level abstraction and detailed analysis. The core components defining this layer are AbstractionAgent and DetailsAgent. The layer operates as a two-stage process where the AbstractionAgent first establishes a foundational, high-level understanding of the codebase. This abstract view then serves as input and context for the DetailsAgent, which performs a more granular analysis on specific parts. The detailed insights from the DetailsAgent can then feedback to refine or validate the initial abstractions, creating a complementary and iterative analytical workflow.",
