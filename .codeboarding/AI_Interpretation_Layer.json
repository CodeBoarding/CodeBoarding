  "description": "The system's primary function is to acquire and process static analysis data from codebases. The LSPClient acts as the central data acquisition hub, establishing and managing communication with external Language Servers via the Language Server Protocol. These Language Servers provide raw code intelligence, which the LSPClient then processes and makes available. This processed data is consumed by two specialized agents: the AbstractionAgent, which focuses on generating high-level architectural representations, and the DetailsAgent, which performs in-depth, granular analysis of specific code sections. The LSPClient also incorporates enhanced integration capabilities for environments like VSCode, optimizing its operation within development workflows. Project-wide external dependencies and packaging configurations are managed by the Unclassified component, supporting the overall system's operational integrity.",
