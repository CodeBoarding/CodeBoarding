  "description": "The system's core revolves around the LSPClient, which establishes and manages communication with external Language Servers to gather comprehensive static analysis data. This client now incorporates enhanced mechanisms for defining, detecting, and configuring programming languages, making it a more sophisticated and flexible data acquisition layer. The collected data is then channeled to two specialized agents: the AbstractionAgent, which distills high-level architectural views, and the DetailsAgent, which performs granular analysis of specific code sections. External Language Servers provide the raw code intelligence, while the Unclassified component manages project dependencies and packaging, ensuring the operational integrity of the entire system.",
