  "description": "The system's core functionality revolves around two primary agents, AbstractionAgent and DetailsAgent, which are responsible for interpreting static analysis data at different levels of granularity. Both agents rely on a conceptual LLM_Provider_Interface to interact with Large Language Models. This interface acts as a crucial abstraction layer, standardizing communication with various LLM providers and handling underlying complexities like API calls and authentication. The architecture is centered on two specialized agents, AbstractionAgent and DetailsAgent, each designed for distinct levels of static analysis interpretation. The AbstractionAgent focuses on high-level architectural understanding, while the DetailsAgent delves into granular code specifics. Both agents communicate with external Large Language Models through a unified LLM_Provider_Interface. This interface is a critical abstraction, managing the complexities of LLM interactions and ensuring a consistent communication layer for the agents. This design promotes modularity and allows for flexible integration with different LLM services, enabling the agents to effectively process and interpret static analysis data to generate comprehensive architectural insights.",
