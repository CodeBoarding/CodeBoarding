  "description": "The AI Interpretation Layer serves as the intelligent core of the system, responsible for processing various inputs to generate architectural insights. The `AIInterpreter` acts as the central orchestrator, coordinating the flow of information and tasks. It leverages the `PromptGenerator` to craft context-rich prompts based on static analysis data and code diffs. These prompts are then sent to the `LLMAgentManager`, which handles the complexities of interacting with diverse LLM providers, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. Upon receiving responses from the LLMs, the `AIInterpreter` forwards them to the `ResponseParser` for validation, extraction, and transformation into structured architectural insights. Finally, the `KnowledgeBase` is utilized by the `AIInterpreter` to store and retrieve past insights, enhancing the accuracy and consistency of future analyses. This layered approach ensures a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture for AI-driven architectural analysis.",
