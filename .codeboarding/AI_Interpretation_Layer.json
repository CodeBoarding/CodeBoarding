  "description": "The system operates with an Application Orchestrator at its core, managing the overall flow from user query to final response. It initiates the QueryProcessor to handle and embed incoming queries, which are then used by the DocumentRetriever to query the VectorStore for relevant documents. A key enhancement is the PromptFactory, which now employs an abstract factory pattern to centralize and standardize prompt generation for various agents and language models, including specialized prompts for Gemini Flash. The Application Orchestrator and ResponseGenerator both interact with the PromptFactory to obtain optimized prompts, enabling the ResponseGenerator to craft accurate and contextually rich natural language responses based on the retrieved documents and the user's query. This modular design ensures extensibility and consistent interaction with large language models.",
