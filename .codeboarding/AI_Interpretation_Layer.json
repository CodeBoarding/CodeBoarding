  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the LSPClient, which serves as a robust data acquisition layer, orchestrating communication with various Language Servers (External) to gather comprehensive static analysis data. This client, now enhanced with flexible language configuration and VSCode integration, efficiently collects diverse code intelligence. The collected data is then channeled to two specialized analytical components: the AbstractionAgent and the DetailsAgent. The AbstractionAgent consumes high-level data to identify major system components and their interconnections, forming an abstract architectural representation. Concurrently, the DetailsAgent utilizes detailed data to perform granular analysis, uncovering implementation specifics and design patterns. Both agents leverage expanded internal tooling to process this data, ensuring a thorough and multi-faceted understanding of the codebase. This design facilitates a clear separation of concerns, enabling efficient and scalable architectural analysis.",
