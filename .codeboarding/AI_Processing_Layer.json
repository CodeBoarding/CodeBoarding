  "description": "The core of the system revolves around two primary agents, `AbstractionAgent` and `DetailsAgent`, which collaboratively perform a multi-stage analysis of a project. The `AbstractionAgent` initiates the process by conducting a high-level architectural analysis, identifying abstract components, and classifying files. This initial analysis then feeds into the `DetailsAgent`, which performs a more granular, in-depth examination of each identified component. Both agents rely on the `PromptFactory` for dynamic prompt generation tailored to specific LLM providers and tasks, ensuring consistent and flexible interaction with Large Language Models. The `LLMConfig` component provides a centralized configuration for these LLM interactions, managing model selection and API parameters. This structured approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture, from abstract components to detailed internal structures.",
