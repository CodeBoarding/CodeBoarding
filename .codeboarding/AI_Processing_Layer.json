  "description": "The system processes user queries through a structured flow, leveraging a language model and specialized tools, with static analysis capabilities. The Query Processor initiates the interaction, passing parsed queries to the Language Model Interface. The language model's output then guides the Tool Executor, which orchestrates tool usage, potentially consulting the Static Analysis Provider for validation or information. Finally, the Response Formatter synthesizes all outputs into a coherent response, delivered back via the Query Processor.",
