## Details

This graph represents the core functionality of a system that processes user queries, generates responses using a language model, and potentially interacts with external tools. The main flow involves receiving a query, parsing it, generating a response, and then presenting it to the user. Its purpose is to provide an intelligent conversational interface.

### QueryProcessor
Handles incoming user queries, including parsing and initial validation.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `QueryParser:parse`
- `QueryValidator:validate`


### LanguageModel
Generates responses based on processed queries using a large language model.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `LLM:generate_response`


### ToolExecutor
Executes external tools or APIs as directed by the language model.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `ToolRegistry:get_tool`
- <a href="https://github.com/CodeBoarding/CodeBoarding/blob/mainagents/tools/external_deps.py#L57-L95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`ExternalTool:execute`:57-95</a>


### ResponseFormatter
Formats the generated response for presentation to the user.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- <a href="https://github.com/CodeBoarding/CodeBoarding/blob/mainoutput_generators/markdown.py#L42-L90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`Formatter:format`:42-90</a>


### Unclassified
Component for all unclassified files and utility functions (Utility functions/External Libraries/Dependencies)


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_
