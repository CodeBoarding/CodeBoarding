  "description": "The `CodeBoardingAgent` acts as the intelligent core of the code inspection subsystem, orchestrating the analysis process. It leverages the `CodeBoardingToolkit` to access a suite of specialized tools for in-depth code examination. This interaction allows the agent to dynamically select and apply the most relevant analysis capabilities, transforming raw code data into structured insights. The `CodeBoardingToolkit`, in turn, provides the foundational static analysis functionalities, making it a critical dependency for the agent's operations.",
