  "description": "The Output Generation Engine is orchestrated by the Output Format Dispatcher, a conceptual component responsible for directing AI-interpreted insights to the appropriate specialized output generators based on the desired format. This dispatcher ensures a clear separation of concerns, adhering to a pipeline architectural pattern. Key specialized generators include the Markdown Generator, which produces human-readable documentation, and the HTML Generator, which creates rich, web-based reports. These components collectively transform raw insights into various structured documentation formats, enabling flexible integration and presentation.",
