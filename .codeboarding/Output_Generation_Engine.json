  "description": "The output generation subsystem is orchestrated by the `Output Generation Engine`, which manages the end-to-end process of transforming architectural insights into various documentation formats. This engine first performs repository setup and analysis generation, then dynamically dispatches the resulting insights to specialized generators based on the required output format. The `GitHub Action Output Generator` is responsible for producing documentation in HTML, Markdown, and MDX, primarily for integration into GitHub Actions workflows. Concurrently, the `Sphinx Output Generator` focuses on creating structured reStructuredText (RST) documentation, catering to projects that utilize Sphinx for comprehensive and customizable documentation. This modular design ensures flexibility in output formats while maintaining a clear separation of concerns for each generation process.",
