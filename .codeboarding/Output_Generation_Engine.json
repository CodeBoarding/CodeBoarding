  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around a pipeline-driven approach, with the Agent Component serving as the primary orchestrator. It initiates the static analysis process by engaging the Static Analysis Component, which has been significantly enhanced to provide sophisticated AI-interpreted insights across various programming languages. Once these insights are generated, the Agent Component directs them to the Output Format Dispatcher. This dispatcher then intelligently delegates the task of transforming these insights into diverse documentation formats, such as Markdown, HTML, MDX, or Sphinx, to specialized generator components. This design ensures a modular, extensible, and efficient workflow for code analysis and documentation generation.",
