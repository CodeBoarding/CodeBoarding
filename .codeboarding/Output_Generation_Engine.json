  "description": "This subsystem is designed to translate complex architectural analysis into clear, structured documentation and visual representations. The primary flow begins with the AI Interpretation Layer, which processes raw project data to extract and formulate structured architectural insights. These insights represent the core understanding of the system's design and components. The critical interaction pathway involves the AI Interpretation Layer sending these structured architectural insights directly to the Output Generation Engine. The Output Generation Engine then takes on the responsibility of transforming these insights into various consumable formats. This includes generating human-readable documentation (e.g., Markdown reports) and machine-readable data (e.g., JSON) that can be used for automated diagram generation. This ensures a consistent and automated pipeline from AI-driven analysis to final architectural documentation.",
