  "description": "The system operates as a sophisticated documentation generation pipeline, orchestrated by the central `Agent Component`. This component, having undergone recent enhancements, now more robustly coordinates the entire workflow. It initiates by leveraging the `Static Analysis Component` to acquire AI-interpreted insights from the codebase. These refined insights are then intelligently dispatched by the `Agent Component` to either the `Output Format Dispatcher` for conversion into various textual documentation formats (Markdown, HTML, MDX, Sphinx) or to the `Diagram Generation Component` for visual representations. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexible and extensible documentation and diagram generation capabilities.",
