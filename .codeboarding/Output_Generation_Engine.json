  "description": "The system is designed around a core `Agent Component` that orchestrates the static analysis and documentation generation workflow. It leverages the `Static Analysis Component` to acquire AI-interpreted insights from the codebase, which are then channeled to the `Output Format Dispatcher`. This dispatcher intelligently routes the insights to specialized generators, such as `Markdown Generator`, `HTML Generator`, `Mdx Generator`, and `Sphinx Generator`, to produce documentation in various formats. The `Static Analysis Component` has been significantly enhanced with robust IDE integration, particularly for VS Code, improving the delivery of insights directly within the development environment. Supporting infrastructure and utilities are managed under the `Unclassified` component.",
