  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around an Output Generation Engine that transforms AI-interpreted insights into various documentation formats. This process begins with the Static Analysis Component, which is responsible for generating the core \"AI-interpreted insights\" from code analysis. These insights are then passed to the Output Format Dispatcher, the central orchestrator of the engine. The Dispatcher, based on the requested output format, delegates the task to specialized generators: the Markdown Generator, HTML Generator, Mdx Generator, and Sphinx Generator. Each generator is responsible for producing high-quality documentation in its specific format, ensuring a flexible and extensible output pipeline. This design promotes a clear separation of concerns, allowing for independent development and enhancement of both the analysis and output generation capabilities.",
