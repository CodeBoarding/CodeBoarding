  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the `Agent Component`, which serves as the primary orchestrator for the entire documentation generation process. This `Agent Component` initiates the workflow by interacting with the `Static Analysis Component` to retrieve AI-interpreted insights from the codebase. Once these insights are obtained, the `Agent Component` then dispatches them, along with the desired output format, to the `Output Format Dispatcher`. The `Output Format Dispatcher` acts as a central hub, delegating the task of converting these insights into specific documentation formats to specialized generators such as the `Markdown Generator`, `HTML Generator`, `Mdx Generator`, and `Sphinx Generator`. This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexible and extensible documentation generation capabilities.",
