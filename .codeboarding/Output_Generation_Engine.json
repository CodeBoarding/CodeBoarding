  "description": "The system is structured around three core components: the AI Interpretation Layer, the Diagram Generation Engine, and the Documentation & Report Generator. The AI Interpretation Layer serves as the foundational analysis component, extracting structured architectural insights from the codebase. These insights are then consumed by both the Diagram Generation Engine to visualize the architecture and the Documentation & Report Generator to produce comprehensive human-readable documentation. The Diagram Generation Engine further provides its generated diagrams to the Documentation & Report Generator for inclusion in final reports, ensuring a cohesive and visually rich output.",
