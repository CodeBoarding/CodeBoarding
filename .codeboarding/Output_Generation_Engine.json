  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the `Agent Component`, which acts as the primary orchestrator for static analysis and documentation generation. This component leverages its enhanced information-gathering capabilities to interact with the `Static Analysis Component`, a crucial upstream dependency responsible for performing robust code analysis and generating \"AI-interpreted insights.\" These insights, enriched by the `Static Analysis Component`'s strengthened LSP client integration and sophisticated language understanding, are then dispatched by the `Agent Component` to two distinct pathways: the `Output Format Dispatcher` and the `Diagram Generation Component`. The `Output Format Dispatcher` delegates the conversion of insights into various textual documentation formats (Markdown, HTML, MDX, Sphinx) via specialized generators, while the newly recognized `Diagram Generation Component` provides visual representations of the analysis results. This modular design ensures a clear separation of concerns, supporting a flexible and extensible pipeline for both comprehensive documentation and insightful visualizations.",
