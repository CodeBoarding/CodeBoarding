  "description": "The analysis subsystem follows a context-aware hierarchical refinement pattern. The process begins with the Meta-Context Analyst establishing project-wide constraints, which are passed to the Structural Abstractionist to map the high-level architecture. A Strategic Planner then manages the transition from this global view to granular \"deep-dives\" performed by the Component Detailer. The entire lifecycle is governed by a Quality Gate that enforces consistency between LLM insights and actual code structures, while Incremental Sync ensures the system only re-analyzes components impacted by recent code changes. All agents inherit from a unified Agent Foundation to ensure consistent LLM interaction and tool usage.",
