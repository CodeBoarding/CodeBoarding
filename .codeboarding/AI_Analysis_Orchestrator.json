  "description": "The AI analysis workflow is orchestrated by the Meta-Orchestration Agent, which serves as the central conductor, initiating analysis tasks and delegating specific queries to Specialized Analysis Agents. These specialized agents perform in-depth analysis, leveraging Agent Tooling to interact with the codebase and extract granular insights. Both the Meta-Orchestration Agent and Specialized Analysis Agents utilize Agent Tooling for their operational needs. Upon completing their tasks, both types of agents send their analytical outputs to Agent Response Management. This component is crucial for structuring, validating, and managing all generated responses, ensuring consistency and readiness for downstream consumption. The Meta-Orchestration Agent then synthesizes the findings received from the Specialized Analysis Agents to form a comprehensive architectural understanding.",
