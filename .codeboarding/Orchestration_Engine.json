  "description": "The CodeBoarding system is orchestrated by the `Orchestration Engine`, which acts as the central control unit for the entire code analysis and documentation generation pipeline. It initiates the process by interacting with the `MetaAgent` to gather architectural context and project metadata. Subsequently, it invokes the `PlannerAgent` to generate a structured plan for analyzing various components of the codebase. The `Orchestration Engine` then delegates specific analysis and execution tasks to the `CodeBoardingAgent`, which serves as a foundational worker agent. The `CodeBoardingAgent` provides core capabilities such as interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs), accessing various tools for reading source code, file structures, and Control Flow Graphs (CFGs), and handling robust invocation mechanisms with error handling. This collaborative interaction between the `Orchestration Engine` and its specialized agents ensures a comprehensive and structured approach to code analysis and documentation.",
