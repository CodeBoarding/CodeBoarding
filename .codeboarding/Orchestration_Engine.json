  "description": "The system operates as a sophisticated analysis pipeline orchestrated by the Orchestration Engine. This engine initiates the process by leveraging the Static Analysis Engine to gather foundational code data. Subsequently, it coordinates a suite of specialized AI agents: the Meta Agent for initial project context, the Abstraction Agent for high-level architectural insights, the Details Agent for granular component analysis, the Planner Agent for dynamic task sequencing, and the Validator Agent for quality assurance. Each agent contributes to a progressively refined understanding of the codebase, with the Orchestration Engine managing the flow of information and feedback loops. Finally, the Output Generation Engine consolidates and formats the comprehensive architectural analysis into structured outputs, ready for documentation and visualization. This design emphasizes a modular, AI-driven approach to software architecture analysis, ensuring accuracy and adaptability.",
