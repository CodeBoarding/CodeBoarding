  "description": "The system operates with the Orchestration Engine at its core, initiating processes via the API Service and managing job states through the Job Database. The Repository Manager fetches and filters code, which is then passed to the Static Analysis Engine. This engine, now enhanced with advanced reference resolution capabilities, performs detailed code analysis. The results are then forwarded to the AI Interpretation Layer, where specialized agents like MetaAgent and PlannerAgent, supported by refined validation mechanisms from the ValidatorAgent, generate architectural insights and strategic analysis plans. Finally, these insights are returned to the Orchestration Engine for documentation delivery via the API Service.",
