  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around an `Orchestration Engine` that manages the entire code analysis and documentation generation workflow. It interfaces with an `API Service` for job initiation and delivery, and a `Job Database` for status management. Code acquisition and filtering are handled by the `Repository Manager`, which then feeds into the `Static Analysis Engine` for initial code analysis. The core intelligence resides in the `AI Interpretation Layer`, which, leveraging a recently updated agent framework, employs specialized `MetaAgent` and `PlannerAgent` components to derive architectural insights and strategic analysis plans from the static analysis results. These insights are then relayed back to the `Orchestration Engine` for final documentation generation and delivery.",
