  "description": "The Orchestration Engine serves as the central control point, initiating and overseeing the entire code analysis and documentation generation process. It delegates strategic planning to the Meta-Agent, which defines high-level goals and approaches. The Meta-Agent then directs the Planner Agent to translate these strategies into concrete, executable tasks. The Planner Agent is responsible for the tactical execution, reporting its progress and outcomes back to the Meta-Agent, which in turn provides updates to the Orchestration Engine. This hierarchical delegation ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the Orchestration Engine managing the overall workflow, the Meta-Agent handling strategic decisions, and the Planner Agent focusing on tactical execution.",
