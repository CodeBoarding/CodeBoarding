  "description": "The CodeBoarding tooling subsystem is designed around a Factory-Manager pattern, where the Tooling Orchestrator (CodeBoardingToolkit) centralizes the instantiation and lifecycle of all repository-aware tools. The subsystem separates concerns between execution analysis (CFGs and call paths), structural analysis (inheritance and packages), and context resolution (source code reading). All these functional tools rely on the Graph Modeling Engine as their foundational data provider, which stores the results of static analysis in unified structures like CallGraph and StaticAnalysisResults. This separation ensures that while tools operate independently to serve agent requests, they maintain a consistent view of the codebase through shared repository context and normalized graph nodes.",
