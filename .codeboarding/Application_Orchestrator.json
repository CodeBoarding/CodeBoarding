  "description": "The CodeBoarding system operates through a centralized Application Orchestrator that manages the entire documentation generation workflow. It begins by interacting with the Repository Manager to acquire the source code, either by cloning remote repositories or processing local ones. Once the code is available, the Orchestrator directs it to the Analysis Engine, which is responsible for parsing the code, generating an intermediate representation, and performing static analysis. The results from the Analysis Engine are then fed into the AI Interpretation Layer, where AI models process the IR for semantic understanding. Finally, the Output Generation Engine takes the interpreted insights and produces comprehensive documentation. The Application Orchestrator also configures the AI Interpretation Layer, ensuring proper integration with underlying LLM providers. This modular design ensures a clear separation of concerns and a streamlined process for generating code documentation.",
