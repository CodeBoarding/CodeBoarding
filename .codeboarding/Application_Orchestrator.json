  "description": "The Application Orchestrator subsystem acts as the central control unit, managing the entire workflow from initiating analysis to integrating results and coordinating output generation. It is primarily encapsulated within the `agents` package, utilizing `agents.planner_agent` and `agents.agent` modules. Within this subsystem, the `PlannerAgent` specializes in managing the initial planning phase of the code analysis, extending the `CodeBoardingAgent` which provides fundamental AI interaction and tool integration capabilities. This hierarchical structure enables specialized agents to coordinate workflow steps built upon a generic AI interaction layer, effectively implementing an \"Orchestration Engine\" pattern.",
