  "description": "The system operates with the Orchestration Engine (Agent Core) as its central control unit, dynamically managing the entire code analysis workflow. It initiates analysis requests received from the User Interface / API Gateway, then coordinates with the Repository Manager for codebase access. The Orchestration Engine directs the codebase to the Static Analysis Engine for structural analysis and leverages the LLM Prompt Factory to generate context-aware prompts. These prompts and analysis results are then processed by the AI Interpretation Layer to generate architectural insights. Finally, the Orchestration Engine guides these insights through the Output Generation Engine and Diagram Analysis & Renderer for structured output and visualization, which are ultimately presented back via the User Interface / API Gateway. The recent enhancements within the Orchestration Engine reflect an evolution in its internal logic, leading to more sophisticated state management and refined coordination mechanisms across all components.",
