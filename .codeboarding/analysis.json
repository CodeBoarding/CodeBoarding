  "description": "The system operates through a pipeline orchestrated by the `Orchestration Engine`. This engine first activates the `Static Analysis Engine`, which is responsible for parsing source code, generating Control Flow Graphs (CFGs), and critically, applying advanced adaptive clustering algorithms to abstract these CFGs into logical architectural components. These refined, clustered components are then passed to the `AI Processing Layer`, where Large Language Models interpret them to derive architectural insights and identify relationships. Subsequently, the `Output Generation Engine` takes these insights and formats them into various outputs, including data specifically structured for the `Diagram Generation Service`, which visualizes the architecture. This re-engineered `Static Analysis Engine` plays a pivotal role in transforming raw code into actionable architectural representations, significantly enhancing the overall analysis quality.",
