  "description": "The CodeBoarding application provides an API for users to initiate and manage codebase analysis jobs. An Orchestration Engine coordinates the entire analysis pipeline, starting with preparing the development environment and retrieving source code. It then triggers a Static Analysis Engine to extract detailed structural information. The results are passed to specialized AI Interpretation Agents, which leverage an LLM Agent Framework and Codebase Interaction Tools to generate high-level architectural insights. Finally, the Orchestration Engine uses these insights to produce various documentation and visual reports.",
