Now, here is the projectâ€™s main package/directory structure, expressed as hierarchy/graphs:

{structure_graph}

**Your Tasks:**
1. Map the previously identified key modules and abstractions to specific packages/directories/files.
2. Identify any additional important components that are evident from the structure (e.g., large packages, central directories, or clearly separated components).
3. Suggest a set of high-level abstract classes or components that best represent the project as a whole, considering both the raw structure and your earlier insight.

You have access to the source code of the project via the provided `read_source_code` tool.

**Your Tasks:**
1. Use the read_source_code tool to read the source code of the modules and components you need further details about.
2. Refine or expand the earlier high-level classes/components, in the end you have to have NO MORE than 10 components (best if they are 5), based on new details from the source code.
3. Define each component by its name, relevant documents and a short concise description.

**Your Tasks:**
Generate an onboarding document that describes the project and its components.
1. Generate a short description of the project, what is its purpose and functionality.
2. Generate a flow diagram (in Mermaid format) that describes the main flow of the project, it has to be a high-level overview of the project. The connections between the components should be clear and have to be described with one word like ("uses", "calls", "sends document"), in mermaid always use ComponentA--ConnectionDescription-->ComponentB..
3. Do a short one paragraph description of each component from the Mermaid diagram, what is its purpose and functionality is.

We are exploring one of the components of a big project `{project_name}`.
Your task now is to generate a general overview of the component, its structure, flow, and its purpose.
