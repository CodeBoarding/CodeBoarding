## Details

The AI Interpretation Layer subsystem is primarily defined by the `agents` package. It is the overarching core intelligence component that orchestrates AI-driven analysis, interprets LLM responses, and derives architectural insights. It acts as a multi-agent system, transforming raw LLM outputs and static analysis data into structured architectural knowledge, aligning with the project's AI-centric and pipeline-driven architectural bias.

## Details

The prompt generation subsystem is centered around the `PromptFactory`, which serves as the primary interface for constructing LLM-optimized prompts. Instead of directly implementing prompt generation logic, `PromptFactory` leverages a composition pattern, utilizing an instance of `AbstractPromptFactory`. This `AbstractPromptFactory` defines the common interface for prompt creation, allowing various concrete prompt factories (e.g., for different LLMs like Gemini Flash or Claude) to provide specific implementations. This architectural choice ensures modularity, extensibility, and a consistent approach to prompt generation across diverse analysis tasks within the project's AI Interpretation Layer.

### AbstractPromptFactory
This component establishes the contract and defines the interface for prompt generation. It ensures a consistent and standardized approach to creating prompts, regardless of the specific LLM or analysis task. Concrete prompt factories (e.g., `GeminiFlashBidirectionalPromptFactory`, `ClaudeBidirectionalPromptFactory`) implement this interface to provide specific prompt generation logic. This aligns with the project's emphasis on modularity and extensibility.

### PromptFactory
This component acts as the primary orchestrator for dynamically generating and formatting prompts. It interprets static analysis results, applies task-specific parameters, and constructs LLM-optimized prompts by *composing* and *delegating* the actual prompt generation to an instance of `AbstractPromptFactory`. This design allows `PromptFactory` to remain decoupled from the specifics of prompt generation, promoting flexibility and extensibility. As the central executor of prompt generation, it is crucial to the "AI Interpretation Layer" and the "pipeline-driven, AI-centric approach" of the project.

## Details

The `agents` subsystem is centered around the `CodeBoardingAgent`, which acts as the primary `Agent` and also embodies the `LLM Provider Gateway` and `LLM Client Orchestrator` functionalities. The `CodeBoardingAgent` directly manages the selection and initialization of various `Specific LLM Integrations` (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatAnthropic`) based on available API keys. This design allows the agent to dynamically adapt to different LLM providers without external factory components. The `Agent` sends requests to the `LLM Provider Gateway` (which is part of itself) and receives responses, abstracting the underlying LLM communication details. The `LLM Client Orchestrator` within the `CodeBoardingAgent` is responsible for instantiating the correct `Specific LLM Integrations`, which then handle the actual communication with external LLM services.

### LLM Provider Gateway [[Expand]](./LLM_Provider_Gateway.md)
This is the overarching conceptual component that acts as a facade for all LLM interactions. It manages the lifecycle of LLM requests, from receiving a request to delegating to the appropriate client and handling initial response processing. It embodies the "Modular Architecture" by providing a consistent interface regardless of the underlying LLM provider.

### LLM Client Orchestrator
This component, embodied by the `CodeBoardingAgent`, is responsible for dynamically selecting and initializing specific LLM client implementations (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`). It directly manages the configuration and instantiation of various LLM providers based on available API keys, promoting a flexible "Plugin/Extension Architecture" within the agent itself.

### Specific LLM Integrations
These are the concrete implementations of various LLM clients (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatAnthropic`, `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`, `ChatBedrockConverse`, `ChatCerebras`, `ChatOllama`) directly used by the `LLM Client Orchestrator`. Each integration handles the unique API calls, authentication, and data formatting for a particular external LLM provider, enforcing "Separation of Concerns" by isolating provider-specific logic.

### Agent
The primary orchestrator within the `agents` package that initiates requests for LLM interactions.

## Details

The system is structured around three core components: the AI Interpretation Layer, the Diagram Generation Engine, and the Documentation & Report Generator. The AI Interpretation Layer serves as the foundational analysis component, extracting structured architectural insights from the codebase. These insights are then consumed by both the Diagram Generation Engine to visualize the architecture and the Documentation & Report Generator to produce comprehensive human-readable documentation. The Diagram Generation Engine further provides its generated diagrams to the Documentation & Report Generator for inclusion in final reports, ensuring a cohesive and visually rich output.

### AI Interpretation Layer [[Expand]](./AI_Interpretation_Layer.md)
This component is responsible for analyzing the codebase to extract and generate structured architectural insights. It acts as the primary source of high-level architectural understanding, which is then consumed by other components for documentation and diagram generation.

## Details

The core of this subsystem is the `Repository Manager`, which serves as the central gateway for all interactions with code repositories. It provides essential functionalities such as cloning, updating, and reading repository contents, making raw source code and metadata accessible. This information is then consumed by the `Static Analysis Engine` for in-depth code examination. Intelligent `agents` and their specialized `agents.tools` rely on the `Repository Manager` to access and manipulate codebase information, facilitating their operational tasks. Furthermore, the `diagram_analysis` component leverages the `Repository Manager` to retrieve necessary data for generating and analyzing architectural diagrams. This design establishes a clear, centralized mechanism for managing and distributing repository data across various analytical and operational components.

### Repository Manager [[Expand]](./Repository_Manager.md)
This component is responsible for all interactions with code repositories. It handles fundamental operations such as cloning repositories, updating their state, reading specific files, and navigating the project's directory structure. It serves as the primary source for raw source code and repository-specific metadata (e.g., Git diffs), making this information available for subsequent analysis stages. Its role is crucial for ingesting the initial data into the codebase analysis pipeline.

## Details

The static analysis subsystem is designed to process a codebase, extract structural and relational information, and present it in a standardized format. The ProjectScanner initiates the process by identifying programming languages and basic code statistics. This information is then used to set up language-specific analysis clients. The core of the analysis involves building call graphs and extracting dependencies, primarily handled by the CallGraph component. Finally, the StaticAnalyzer orchestrates these steps, aggregates the results, and normalizes them into a structured StaticAnalysisResults object, making the data ready for consumption by other systems, such as an LLM Prompt Factory.

### Scanner
This component is responsible for the initial ingestion and high-level analysis of the codebase. It utilizes external tools (like Tokei) to identify programming languages present in the repository, along with their code statistics and file suffixes. This provides a foundational understanding of the project's technological landscape.

## Details

The CodeBoarding system is designed to provide comprehensive code analysis and architectural insights using a combination of static analysis and AI interpretation. The Repository Manager initiates the process by providing source code to the Static Analysis Engine, which extracts critical structural and control flow data. This data is then fed into the AI Interpretation Layer, the core intelligence component. The AI Interpretation Layer leverages the LLM Prompt Factory to generate tailored prompts and interacts with various LLM Provider Gateway implementations to obtain AI responses. Finally, the Output Generation Engine transforms these AI-driven insights into human-readable documentation and visual diagrams, which are then delivered to User/External Systems.
