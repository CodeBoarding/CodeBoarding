## Details

The system is structured around a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, orchestrated by the `Application Orchestrator`. This orchestrator directs the `QueryProcessor` to handle incoming user queries, which are then processed and used by the `DocumentRetriever` to fetch relevant information from the `VectorStore`. A central `PromptFactory` provides standardized and optimized prompts for various language models, including Gemini Flash, Claude, and now GPT, which are utilized by both the `Application Orchestrator` and the `ResponseGenerator`. The `ResponseGenerator` synthesizes the retrieved documents and generated prompts to formulate the final user response. Complementing this core RAG flow, a `Static Analyzer` operates independently, offering specialized analysis capabilities, particularly for TypeScript configurations.

### Application Orchestrator
Manages the overall application flow, coordinating interactions between QueryProcessor, DocumentRetriever, ResponseGenerator, and leveraging the PromptFactory for agent prompt generation. It receives user queries and delivers final responses, adapting its agent coordination mechanisms due to recent core agent logic refactoring and the new prompt management system.

### PromptFactory
Centralizes the creation and management of prompts for various agents and language models through an abstract factory pattern. It provides a structured and standardized approach to prompt generation, leveraging an AbstractPromptFactory interface and specialized implementations like GeminiFlashPromptsBidirectional, GeminiFlashPromptsUnidirectional, ClaudePromptsBidirectional, ClaudePromptsUnidirectional, GPTPromptsBidirectional, and GPTPromptsUnidirectional. This ensures consistent and optimized interactions with LLMs, notably for Gemini Flash, Claude, and GPT models, by managing an expanded library of prompts.

### Static Analyzer
An independent functional area responsible for performing static analysis, primarily focusing on TypeScript configurations. This component has been significantly enhanced with the integration of a dedicated Language Server Protocol (LSP) client for TypeScript, enabling more sophisticated and in-depth analysis by leveraging the full capabilities of a TypeScript Language Server. It now also incorporates graph-based analysis capabilities to provide deeper insights. It operates in parallel to the core RAG system, providing distinct capabilities without directly altering the RAG data flow.

## Details

The system begins with the AI Interpretation Layer, which processes raw information and generates detailed architectural insights. These insights are then fed into the Output Generation Engine, the central orchestrator responsible for managing the documentation creation process. The Output Generation Engine delegates the actual generation of specific documentation formats to specialized components. For GitHub Actions environments, the GitHub Action Output Generator creates HTML, Markdown, and MDX outputs. For projects requiring comprehensive, versioned documentation, the Sphinx Output Generator produces Sphinx-compatible (RST) documentation. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing for flexible and extensible documentation generation tailored to various deployment and consumption needs.

### AI Interpretation Layer [[Expand]](./AI_Interpretation_Layer.md)

## Details

The static analysis subsystem is designed to systematically process and understand a codebase. The `Scanner` initiates the analysis by identifying relevant files and programming languages. The `LSP Client` then interacts with language servers to extract rich semantic information, leveraging the `TypeScript Config Scanner` for language-specific configurations. This raw and semantic data is fed into the `Graph Builder`, which constructs various graph representations of the code, such as call graphs. The `Reference Resolver` utilizes these graphs and the `LSP Client` to trace and resolve code references. Finally, the `Analysis Result Emitter` formats the structured analysis results for consumption by other parts of the system, such as an AI interpretation layer. This architecture ensures a comprehensive and extensible approach to static code analysis.

### Scanner
Orchestrates the initial phase of code analysis. It's responsible for traversing the codebase, identifying files for analysis, and initiating the parsing process. It acts as the entry point for feeding raw code into the analysis pipeline.

### LSP Client
Establishes and manages communication with Language Servers (e.g., TypeScript Language Server). It queries language services for Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), symbol information, type definitions, and other rich semantic data. The `TypeScript Client` provides specialized capabilities for TypeScript projects.

### Graph Builder
Constructs and manages graph-based representations of the source code. This includes building ASTs, Control Flow Graphs (CFGs), and Dependency Graphs from the data provided by the `Scanner` and `LSP Client`. It provides algorithms for graph traversal and querying to enable deep code relationship analysis.

## Details

The system's core functionality revolves around the `local_app` component, which acts as the primary interface for external clients. `local_app` processes incoming requests, and based on these, it initiates complex analysis workflows by interacting with the `Orchestration Engine`. To manage and track the state of these analytical tasks, `local_app` queries the `Job Database` for persistent storage of job-related information. Furthermore, `local_app` relies on the `Configuration & Utilities` component for essential operational settings and shared functionalities, ensuring a consistent and efficient execution environment. This architecture delineates clear responsibilities, with `local_app` managing external interactions, the `Orchestration Engine` orchestrating internal processes, the `Job Database` maintaining state, and `Configuration & Utilities` providing foundational support.

### local_app
This component serves as the concrete implementation of the API Gateway, handling all external interactions. It is responsible for processing requests from various clients, initiating analysis workflows through the Orchestration Engine, querying job statuses from the Job Database, and utilizing shared services from Configuration & Utilities for operational parameters and common functions.

## Details

The CodeBoarding project is structured around a core AI Interpretation Layer that orchestrates the analysis of source code to generate architectural insights and documentation. User interactions, whether through a local application, VS Code extension, or GitHub Actions, are managed by the User Interface / API Gateway, which initiates and monitors analysis jobs. These jobs are persisted and managed by the Job Management & Persistence component. The AI Interpretation Layer relies on the Code Repository Access for fetching code and diffs, and the Static Analysis Engine for detailed code structure analysis. Finally, the Output Generation Engine transforms the AI-derived insights into various documentation and diagram formats, which are then presented back to the user via the User Interface / API Gateway.
