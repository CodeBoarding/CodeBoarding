## Details

The AI Interpretation Layer serves as the intelligent core of the system, responsible for processing various inputs to generate architectural insights. The `AIInterpreter` acts as the central orchestrator, coordinating the flow of information and tasks. It leverages the `PromptGenerator` to craft context-rich prompts based on static analysis data and code diffs. These prompts are then sent to the `LLMAgentManager`, which handles the complexities of interacting with diverse LLM providers, ensuring efficient and reliable communication. Upon receiving responses from the LLMs, the `AIInterpreter` forwards them to the `ResponseParser` for validation, extraction, and transformation into structured architectural insights. Finally, the `KnowledgeBase` is utilized by the `AIInterpreter` to store and retrieve past insights, enhancing the accuracy and consistency of future analyses. This layered approach ensures a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture for AI-driven architectural analysis.

### AIInterpreter
The core intelligence component, orchestrating the entire AI interpretation process. It receives input data (static analysis, code diffs), selects and invokes LLM agents, manages prompt generation, parses LLM responses, and ultimately generates architectural insights.

### LLMAgentManager
Manages interactions with various LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Ollama). It handles configuration loading, request routing, API key management, authentication, retry mechanisms, and rate limiting, abstracting these complexities from the `AIInterpreter`.


**Related Classes/Methods**:



### PromptGenerator
Responsible for dynamically constructing effective and context-rich prompts for the LLMs. It integrates static analysis data, code diffs, and specific task instructions to formulate queries that yield relevant architectural insights.


**Related Classes/Methods**:



### ResponseParser

## Details

The feedback highlights that the identified components (JobManager, PersistenceLayer, QueueingMechanism, OrchestrationEngine, APIServiceGateway, OutputGenerationEngine) have incorrect references, as no such modules, functions, or classes exist in the project. The `getFileStructure` output reveals a `.codeboarding` directory containing several `.json` and `.md` files, which likely hold architectural descriptions. To address the feedback, I will first examine the `overview.md` file within the `.codeboarding` directory to gain a high-level understanding of the project's architecture and then investigate other `.md` files for specific component definitions. This approach will help in identifying the correct references for the conceptual components.

## Details

The static analysis subsystem is designed to systematically process and understand a codebase. The `Scanner` initiates the analysis by identifying relevant files and programming languages. The `LSP Client` then interacts with language servers to extract rich semantic information, leveraging the `TypeScript Config Scanner` for language-specific configurations. This raw and semantic data is fed into the `Graph Builder`, which constructs various graph representations of the code, such as call graphs. The `Reference Resolver` utilizes these graphs and the `LSP Client` to trace and resolve code references. Finally, the `Analysis Result Emitter` formats the structured analysis results for consumption by other parts of the system, such as an AI interpretation layer. This architecture ensures a comprehensive and extensible approach to static code analysis.

### Scanner
Orchestrates the initial phase of code analysis. It's responsible for traversing the codebase, identifying files for analysis, and initiating the parsing process. It acts as the entry point for feeding raw code into the analysis pipeline.

## Details

The system's architecture is centered around the `local_app` component, which acts as the primary API Gateway, managing all external client interactions. It orchestrates analysis workflows by initiating tasks with the `Orchestration Engine` and monitors their progress by querying the `Job Database`. For operational parameters and common functionalities, `local_app` leverages shared services from `Configuration & Utilities`. The system also incorporates an `Unclassified` component, which has recently evolved to include an expanded `repo_utils` package with enhanced utilities, particularly for git diff functionalities, and updated GPT prompt definitions within `agents/prompts`, significantly influencing agent behavior. This `Unclassified` component provides essential underlying functionalities utilized by `local_app` and potentially other parts of the system.

## Details

The system is structured around a core `AI Interpretation Layer` that orchestrates code analysis. User interactions, managed by the `User Interface / API Gateway`, initiate jobs whose states are persistently tracked by `Job Management & Persistence`. Source code is acquired and managed by `Code Repository Access`, providing raw code and diffs to both the `Static Analysis Engine` for structural analysis and directly to the `AI Interpretation Layer`. The `AI Interpretation Layer` synthesizes information from static analysis and code changes, leveraging LLMs to generate architectural insights. These insights are then transformed into diagrams and documentation by the `Output Generation Engine` before being presented back to the user via the `User Interface / API Gateway`. This modular design ensures clear separation of concerns, facilitating maintainability and scalability.
