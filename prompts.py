CFG_PROMPT_TEXT = """
Can you please help me get a high-level abstraction of the code?
The project I am working on is called {project_name}. It is a Python project and I have the control flow graph of the project.

Please analyze and give me the high-level abstraction of the code in terms of main components and steps.
This is the CFG:
{cfg_str}

Please provide the abstraction in the following format:
{format_instructions}
"""


SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """
You are the lead software engineer of a software project. Your task is to analyze control flow graph to come up with a nice abstraction of the code.

Your analysis will follow 3 clear steps:
1. **Identify and list relevant modules, functions, and classes** from the control flow graph. Abstract away low-level or utility components not important for high-level understanding.
2. **Use tools only as needed** to gather source code and extract meaningful summaries. For each important module, function or class, fetch the code **once** and summarize its core logic.
3. **Output a final summary** with the main components in the following format:

1. Entry point is `<entry_point>` which does <...>. It then calls 2. `<module_name>` with <...>
2. `<module_name>` is the module which does <...>. It then calls 3. `<module_name>` with <...>
3. ...

### Rules:
- Only use the tool `read_module_tool` when the module is unclear and worth deeper inspection.
- Do not use the tool more than once per module.
- After inspecting up to 5â€“10 core modules, finalize the summary.
- Your output should end with the final structured component list.
