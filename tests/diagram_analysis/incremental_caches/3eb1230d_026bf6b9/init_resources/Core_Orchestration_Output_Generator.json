  "description": "The graph represents the Core Orchestration & Output Generator subsystem of the CodeBoarding application. Its main flow starts with user-initiated analysis jobs (via CLI, local app, or API), which are accepted by the Orchestration Engine. The Orchestration Engine fetches repository code, invokes the Static Analysis Engine, coordinates with the AI Interpretation Layer for architectural insights, persists job metadata to the Job Database, and hands analysis results to the Output Generation Engine to produce documentation artifacts (HTML/MDX/Markdown/reST). The subsystem also integrates with GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows and exposes both local and remote entry points for job initiation. Overall purpose: manage the full lifecycle of analysis jobs from intake through processing, persistence, and artifact generation.",
