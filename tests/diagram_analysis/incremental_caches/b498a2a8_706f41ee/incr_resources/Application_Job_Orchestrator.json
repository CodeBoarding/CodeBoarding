  "description": "The `Application & Job Orchestrator` subsystem is responsible for the overall application lifecycle, including job initiation, execution flow management, and the persistence of analysis jobs. It acts as the central coordinator, handling argument parsing, orchestrating calls to other components, and managing the final output generation, specifically including diagram generation. Its boundaries are defined by the main application entry point, the local job management, job data persistence, and the coordination of specific output generators like the `DiagramGenerator`.",
