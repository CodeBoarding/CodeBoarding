It orchestrates the creation and selection of appropriate LLM-specific prompt factories based on the requested LLM type and interaction style (unidirectional or bidirectional). It also manages the package's public interface and dynamic attribute access, allowing other parts of the system to easily retrieve prompt factories.",
