  "description": "The CodeBoarding application operates as a sophisticated codebase analysis tool, leveraging an agent-based system and a modular architecture to provide deep insights into software projects. The core workflow begins with the Application Workflow & Output Manager orchestrating analysis jobs, managing repositories, and persisting data. It initiates static analysis via the Static Analysis & Code Graph Generator, which meticulously builds code graphs and extracts detailed information. This structured data is then utilized by the LLM Orchestration & Validation Engine, where intelligent agents, guided by context-aware prompts, perform advanced analysis. These agents interact with the codebase through the Codebase Interaction Tools, querying static analysis results and file contents. Throughout the process, the Monitoring & Evaluation System tracks performance and validates analysis quality. Finally, the Application Workflow & Output Manager takes the validated analysis results and renders them into various human-readable and machine-readable formats, including diagrams, for comprehensive documentation.",
