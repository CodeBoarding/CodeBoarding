  "description": "The `Codebase Interaction Tools` subsystem provides LLM agents with a programmatic interface to interact with and query the codebase. Its boundaries encompass all tools and managers necessary for file system access, static code analysis, and adherence to repository ignore rules. The subsystem exhibits a layered and collaborative structure: `CodeBoardingToolkit` acts as the primary interface and orchestrator, `Analysis Tools` represent the core functionality specializing in codebase interaction, `Base Repository Tooling` provides common infrastructure and context, and `Repository Ignore Manager` enforces file and directory exclusion policies. This structure promotes modularity, allowing new analysis tools to be added easily by extending `Base Repository Tooling` and registering with `CodeBoardingToolkit`, while `Repository Ignore Manager` consistently applies filtering policies across the subsystem.",
