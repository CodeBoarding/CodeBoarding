  "description": "The `Orchestration & Job Management` subsystem is the core workflow coordinator for CodeBoarding, handling job lifecycle, persistence, and external triggers. It manages the end-to-end workflow, from parsing CLI arguments and initiating job execution to coordinating analysis steps and handling output generation. This subsystem ensures job state is maintained, provides historical records, and integrates with external systems like GitHub Actions for automated analysis and documentation.",
