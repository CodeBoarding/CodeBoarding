  "description": "The `Static Analysis Engine` subsystem is a core component responsible for extracting deep code intelligence from various programming languages. It acts as the foundational layer for structured code data, which is then consumed by the AI Interpretation Layer. Its primary function is to transform raw source code into a rich, queryable representation, including control flow graphs, call graphs, and resolved code references.",
