  "description": "The AI Agent Tooling subsystem, encapsulated within the `agents.tools` package, provides a controlled and structured interface for AI agents to interact with the codebase and its static analysis results, abstracting direct file system or complex analysis data access. The internal relationships within this subsystem are primarily hierarchical and delegation-based. The `Codebase Toolkit` acts as a composite tool, serving as the primary interface for external AI agents. It delegates specific, fine-grained tasks to the other specialized tools (File Reader Tool, CFG Retrieval Tool, File Structure Tool, Code Reference Reader). This design promotes modularity, allowing each specialized tool to focus on a single responsibility while the `Codebase Toolkit` provides a cohesive and simplified API for agents.",
