# Health Check Exclusion Patterns
# Add patterns here for entities that should be excluded from specific health checks.
# Use fnmatch glob syntax (same as shell wildcards).
#
# Examples:
# - Exclude all functions in evals: evals.*
# - Exclude a specific function: utils.get_project_root
# - Exclude by file path: */evals/*
# - Exclude functions matching a pattern: *._*
#
# This file is automatically loaded by health checks to exclude specified
# entities from analysis and reporting.
