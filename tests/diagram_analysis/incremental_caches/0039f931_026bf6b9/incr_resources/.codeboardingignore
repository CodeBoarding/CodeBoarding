# CodeBoarding Ignore File
# Add patterns here for files and directories that should be excluded from CodeBoarding analysis.
# Use the same format as .gitignore (gitignore syntax / gitwildmatch patterns).
#
# Examples:
# - Ignore a specific directory: my_generated_files/
# - Ignore a file pattern: *.temp
# - Ignore nested patterns: **/cache/
# - Negate a pattern (stop ignoring): !important_file.txt
#
# This file is automatically loaded by CodeBoarding analysis tools to exclude
# specified paths from code analysis, architecture generation, and other processing.
