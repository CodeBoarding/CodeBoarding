  "description": "The Architectural Insight Generator subsystem processes static analysis call graph data and produces higher-level architectural insights by representing code as graphs, applying clustering algorithms to identify logical groupings, and packaging results into standardized cluster representations for downstream consumption. Its main flow constructs and manipulates a CallGraph, runs adaptive clustering algorithms to find related components, and transforms algorithm outputs into structured ClusterResult objects that other tools can use for documentation or further analysis.",
