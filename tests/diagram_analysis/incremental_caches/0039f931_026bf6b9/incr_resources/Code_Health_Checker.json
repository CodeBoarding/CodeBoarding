  "description": "The Code Health Checker subsystem is an automated pipeline within the Codebase Analysis Tool that runs static analysis checks against a codebase, aggregates findings, and produces a comprehensive health report. It begins at a CLI entry point which parses arguments and loads initial configuration, hands control to an orchestrator that dispatches configurable static analysis checkers, uses standardized data models to represent findings and reports, and returns a final HealthReport to the caller. The subsystem manages configuration (including ignore rules), orchestrates multiple specialized checkers, and consolidates results into summaries and scores.",
