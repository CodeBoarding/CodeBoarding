  "description": "The Static Analysis Engine subsystem is responsible for the core logic of extracting structural and behavioral information from the codebase. Its boundaries are defined by the components directly involved in code parsing, language server communication, and the initial stages of data aggregation. The Static Analysis Engine operates as a pipeline where Source File Discoverer initiates the process by identifying files and languages. This information is then used by the Language Configuration Manager to prepare language-specific settings. The LSP Client Core, configured by the Language Configuration Manager and extended by Language-Specific LSP Adapters, communicates with external Language Servers to extract raw code intelligence data. This raw data is then processed by the Reference Resolver and Call Graph Builder to construct structured representations of the codebase. Finally, all generated analysis artifacts are stored in the Analysis Results Repository, making them available for further processing by other parts of the overall system. This flow ensures a modular and extensible approach to static code analysis.",
