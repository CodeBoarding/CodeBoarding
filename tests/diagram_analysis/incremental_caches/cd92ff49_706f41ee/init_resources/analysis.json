  "description": "The CodeBoarding project is designed as a workflow-driven, service-oriented architecture for automated code analysis and documentation generation. At its core, the Orchestration & Job Management component initiates and oversees the entire analysis pipeline, managing job lifecycles and persistence. It triggers the Static Analysis Engine to extract structural and behavioral information from the codebase. The results from static analysis are then fed into the AI Interpretation Engine, which leverages various AI agents and prompt factories to generate high-level insights and documentation. Finally, the Output & Integration Layer consumes these interpreted insights, transforming them into diverse human-readable formats and integrating with external platforms, while also reporting job status back to the orchestration layer. This pipeline ensures a modular and extensible approach to code understanding and documentation.",
